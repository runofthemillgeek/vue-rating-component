# Custom Rating Component using Vue.js

This is a custom rating component which supports two-way data-binding built using Vue.js. The animations are powered by CSS. Currently only supports rating from 1â€“5. You can have a different character from the default star for selected and unselected modes by passing in values for props `selected-char` and `unselected-char`. The component is located in `rating.vue`.

This was just a fun thing I whipped up learning Vue.js. Feel free to remix this.
